int mlx_hook(void *win_ptr, int event, int mask, int (*f)(), void *param);

✅event

Event Name	    Number
Key Press	    2
Key Release	    3
Mouse Press	    4
Mouse Release	5
Mouse Move	    6
Window Close (Red Cross)	17

✅mask
You must give the correct bitmask for the event number you're hooking.
2 = 1L << 0 = 0b0001 

✅(*f)()
This is the callback function — the one that runs when a key is pressed.
For Event Nr. 2 it is expected to have the layout: 
    int (f*)(int keycode, t_struct *game); 


🔔 mlx_hook(game->win, 17, 0, handle_close, game)

🔔 mlx_hook(game->win, 2, 1L << 0, keyboard_input, game);
“On this window (game->win), when a key is pressed (event 2), 
call the function keyboard_input with game as its argument.”
